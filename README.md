# Bright_Network_Internship_Google_Coding_Challenge
My code for the Bright Network Internship Google coding challenge. I have completed all 4 parts and all test requirements have been met.

My solutions to the task can be found in the java/src/main/java/com/google directory.

The code for testing was supplied to me by Bright Network.
